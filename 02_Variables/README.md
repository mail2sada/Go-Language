### Variables

A variable is a piece of storage containing data temporarily to work with it.

The most general form to declare a variable in Golang uses the var keyword, an explicit type, and an assignment.
>>>   var name type = expression

### Declaration with initialization
If you know beforehand what a variable's value will be, you can declare variables and assign them values on the same line.

>>>.  var name type = expression

><i>
      var i int
	  var s string
	  i = 10
	  s = "Canada"
</i>
